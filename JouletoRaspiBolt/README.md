## Connect the Joule browser extension to your RaspiBolt

https://lightningjoule.com/  
Bring the power of lightning to the web with in-browser payments and identity, all with your own node. 


### Preparation on the Pi

* For Joule to work you will need to allow connection to your RaspiBolt from any IP (0.0.0.0). The communications will remain encrypted with TLS, but there is a a risk of a DDOS or other attack.  
    `$ sudo nano /home/bitcoin/.lnd/lnd.conf`  

    Add the following line to your lnd configuration file in the section to `[Application Options]`:
  ```tlsextraip=0.0.0.0```
* Delete tls.cert (restarting LND will recreate it):  
    `$ sudo rm /home/bitcoin/.lnd/tls.*`

* Restart LND :  
  `$ sudo systemctl restart lnd`  
  
* Copy the new tls.cert to user "admin", as it is needed for lncli:  
    `$ sudo cp /home/bitcoin/.lnd/tls.cert /home/admin/.lnd`

* Unlock wallet  
  `$ lncli unlock` 

* Allow the ufw firewall to listen on 8080 from the LAN:  
  `$ sudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/24 to any port 8080 comment 'allow REST api from local LAN'`
  
  For the #RECKLESS it can be opened for any address
  `$ sudo ufw allow from 0.0.0.0 to any port 8080 comment 'allow REST api from ANYWHERE'`

 * restart and check the firewall:  
  `$ sudo ufw enable`  
  `$ sudo ufw status`


### On the Linux desktop

* Install Joule for Chrome  
    https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/joule/aejmoogjdllanidlpfjmmmmimfaficio

* Click to the Joule extension button

* Fill in the LAN address of your RaspiBolt:  
    `https://your.RaspiBolt.LAN.IP:8080`

* Click "try clicking this link" in the error message

* Click the "Not secure" sign left from the URL

* Certificate > Details tab > Export > save the file to your Home directory

    alternatively you can extract the certificate form your node and copy it to your Home dir:
  `$ scp admin@your.RaspiBolt.LAN.IP:/home/admin/.lnd/tls.cert ~/` 

* Menu > Settings > Advanced (on the bottom) > Manage certificates > Authorities tab > Import > Choose to show "all files" and select the file you saved > Tick all three boxes > OK

    The certificate will appear under "org-lnd autogenerated cert" if you would need to modify it later

* Go back to the Joule Tab and try connecting again

* Now you need your macaroons. Copy the admin.macaroon and the readonly.macaroon from your node to your home directory:  
   `$ scp admin@your.RaspiBolt.LAN.IP:/home/bitcoin/.lnd/admin.macaroon ~/`

   `$ scp admin@your.RaspiBolt.LAN.IP:/home/bitcoin/.lnd/readonly.macaroon ~/`
 
* Drop the two macaroon files to the Joule window and continue.

* Confirm your node and create a password for Joule on the next screens and you are good to go.
